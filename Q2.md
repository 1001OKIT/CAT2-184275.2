## 2. Linked Lists vs. Arrays

This section compares linked lists and arrays in terms of memory allocation and performance.

### Memory Allocation

* **Arrays:** Use fixed, contiguous memory allocation. [cite: 12]
* **Linked Lists:** Use non-contiguous, dynamic memory allocation. [cite: 12]

### Performance

* **Arrays:** Provide faster access to elements by index, with a time complexity of O(1). [cite: 12]
* **Linked Lists:** Have a time complexity of O(n) for element access because you have to traverse the list. [cite: 12]
* **Insertion**
