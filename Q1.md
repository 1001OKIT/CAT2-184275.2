## 1. Big O Notation

Big O notation is used to describe the efficiency of algorithms, specifically their time and space complexity. 

### 1.1 Rules of Big O Notation

* **Ignore Constants:** Big O notation disregards constant factors.  For example, O(5n + 3) simplifies to O(n). 
* **Remove Non-Dominant Terms:** Only the fastest-growing term is considered. For example, O(n² + n) simplifies to O(n²). 
* **Multiple Growth Rates:** Common time complexities include:
    * O(1) - Constant Time 
    * O(log n) - Logarithmic Time 
    * O(n) - Linear Time 
    * O(n²) - Quadratic Time 
* **Worst-Case vs. Best-Case Analysis:** Big O typically describes the worst-case scenario. 
    * For example, in a linear search, the best-case time complexity is O(1), and the worst-case time complexity is O(n).
* **Multiplication Rule:**
    * Consecutive loops have complexities that are added.
    * Nested loops have complexities that are multiplied. 
    * Example:
        ```cpp
        for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++) // O(n)
        for(int j = 0; j < n; j++)  // O(n)
        ```
        The overall time complexity of the above code is O(n²). 


    * **Arrays:** Insertion can be time-consuming, with a time complexity of O(n) in the middle of the array because elements have to be shifted.
    * **Linked Lists:** Insertion is efficient, with a time complexity of O(1) at the head if the node pointer is given.
